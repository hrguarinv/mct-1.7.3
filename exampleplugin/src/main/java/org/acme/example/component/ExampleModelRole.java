/**
 * The <code>ExampleModelRole</code> provides a model.  This model can contain an arbitrary complex data structure. 
 * The data contents of the model are persisted by marshalling the model into XML text. 
 * See JavaTM Architecture for XML Binding Reference Implementation (RI) Version: 1.0.5. 
 * 
 * The JAXB annotations specify which parts of the model are persisted.  The XmlRootElement is required, as
 * it specifies the top level java binding to the root XML element.
 * 
 * In this example XmlAccessorType specifies that all fields (public or private) should be marshalled (ie serialized).
