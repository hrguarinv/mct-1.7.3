/**
 * MCT will be able to share any class that has the jaxb {@link javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement} or {@link javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessorType} class annotation. Another
 * option is to use the {@link gov.nasa.arc.mct.services.annotation.Share} class annotation. Using the jaxb annotations will have an
 * additional effect of serializing objects of the class to the model_state table. Using the {@link gov.nasa.arc.mct.services.annotation.Share}
 * annotation will only enable objects of the class to be shareable. The objects will not get serialized to the model_state table.
 * 
 * It is important to note that any field that is marked as transient will not be shared. The class definition should be able to initialize
 * any transient fields properly. Further note that, currently, MCT will not share any field that is of type defined in an external library.
 * Therefore, any such field should be marked as a transient field. 
 * 
 * MCT will add synchronized modifier to any non-private methods for any classes that are annotated with the jaxb {@link javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement} or
 * {@link javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessorType} annotations or any classes that are annotated with the {@link gov.nasa.arc.mct.services.annotation.Share}
 * annotation. This will enable multiple MCT instances to modify and/or access the same share instance correctly. Therefore, one should
 * write the class as if it is only accessed by a single thread.
