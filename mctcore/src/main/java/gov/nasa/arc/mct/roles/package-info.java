/**
 * Provides definitions of interfaces and classes for component roles. There
 * are two types of roles in the MCT system:
 * 
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>Model Roles
 *   <dd>Roles defining the underlying component state, or data. These normally
 *   extend <code>AbstractModelRole</code>.
 *   
 *   <dt>View Roles
 *   <dd>Roles implementing the various visual views of the component that
 *   can be displayed in the UI. These normally extend <code>AbstractViewRole</code>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <p>View role classes also implement one or more interfaces that indicate the
 * uses for that view within the user interface. For example, <code>InspectableViewRole</code>
 * indicates that the view can be shown in the inspector pane. Components should provide
 * a set of views that collectively provide at least one view implementing each of these
 * interfaces:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>NodeViewRole</code> &#x2013; for displaying within the directory tree</li>
 *   <li><code>InspectableViewRole</code> &#x2013; for displaying in the inspector pane</li>
 *   <li><code>CanvasSwitchableViewRole</code> &#x2013; for displaying the canvas area</li>
 *   <li><code>HousingViewRole</code> &#x2013; for displaying the housing layout in a new window</li>
 * </ul>
